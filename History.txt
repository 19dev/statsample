=== 0.2.0 / 2009-08-01

* One Way Anova on Statsample::Anova::OneWay
* Dominance Analysis!!!! The one and only reason to develop a Multiple Regression on pure ruby.
* Multiple Regression on Multiple Regression module. Pairwise (pure ruby) or MultipleRegressionPairwise and Listwise (optimized) on MultipleRegressionAlglib and 
* New Dataset#to_gsl_matrix, #from_to,#[..],#bootstrap,#vector_missing_values, #vector_count_characters, #each_with_index, #collect_with_index
* New Vector#box_cox_transformation
* Module Correlation renamed to Bivariate
* Some fancy methods and classes to create Summaries
* Some documentation about Algorithm used on doc_latex
* Deleted 'distributions' extension. Ruby/GSL has all the pdf and cdf you ever need.
* Tests work without any dependency. Only nags about missing deps. 
* Test for MultipleRegression, Anova, Excel, Bivariate.correlation_matrix and many others 

=== 0.1.9 / 2009-05-22

* Class Vector: new method vector_standarized_pop, []=, min,max
* Class Dataset: global variable $RUBY_SS_ROW stores the row number on each() and related methods. dup() with argument returns a copy of the dataset only for given fields. New methods: standarize, vector_mean, collect, verify,collect_matrix
* Module Correlation: new methods covariance, t_pearson, t_r, prop_pearson, covariance_matrix, correlation_matrix, correlation_probability_matrix
* Module SRS: New methods estimation_n0 and estimation_n
* Module Reliability: new ItemCharacteristicCurve class

* New experimental SPSS Class. 
* Converters: Module CSV with new options. Added write() method for GGobi module 
* New Mx exporter (http://www.vcu.edu/mx/)
* Class SimpleRegression: new methods standard error

* Added tests for regression and reliability, Vector#vector_mean, Dataset#dup (partial)  and Dataset#verify

* Class Dataset: added methods vector_by_calculation, vector_sum, filter_field
* Module Correlation: added methods like spearman, point biserial and tau-b
* Added tests for Vector#ranked, Vector#vector_standarized,  Vector#sum_of_squared_deviation, Dataset#vector_by_calculation, Dataset#vector_sum, Dataset#filter_field and various test for Correlation module
* Added demos: item_analysis and sample_test
